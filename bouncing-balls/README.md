## Bouncing balls

Congratulations for making it to the next round! We’re really excited to meet you and in order for us to better understand your technical skills - we’d like you to complete a task for us.

### Overview and Test Instructions

* Use any combination of web technologies to complete the task.
* All code should be authored by the applicant: do not use game engines, physics engines or 3rd party libraries.
* Submit in a format that is easy for us to run / inspect from the browser.
* Your code should be written as if it were going to be deployed today - i.e. using standard technologies commonly supported by most current browsers.
* **You will be evaluated both on your implementation choices and the quality of your code**; so please ensure code is:
  * well structured
  * extensible 
  * testable
  * readable
  * commented
  * etc...
* You should include some tests for your code.
* Any 3rd party code (at all) should be clearly attributed.

### Challenge
**Stage 1**: Whenever the user clicks on the page, a circle is ‘fired’ from the position being clicked at a random speed and angle. Please ensure that your solution handles multiple balls being fired and bouncing at the same time.

**Stage 2**: When the projectile reaches the bottom of the browser window it should bounce, and eventually come to a stop.

**Stage 3**: Submit

**Bonus**: Any relevant tooling, minification and automation of the workflow.
